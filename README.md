# ASCII Rogue-like Project

## Overview and Credits

This project aims to create a ASCII Rogue-like game from scratch. We used [AsciiPanel](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel) to have a terminal where it was possible to display ASCII characters.
Below is a gallery to see screenshots of our game.

This project was done in Java, as a team project between:
- [Astrostellar06](https://github.com/Astrostellar06) (coded the core mechanics of the game)
- [Demonis0](https://github.com/Demonis0) (coded the random level generation)
- [lorematteo](https://github.com/lorematteo) (coded the main menus, settings and data persistence)
  
All musics are by Seydou Mestre-Kone.

This game offers different features:
- Random level generation
- 3 different player classes
- Different types of ennemies
- A wide range of items (weapons, shield, potions...)
- A combat system
- An inventory system
- A leveling system
- A wide range of player stats
- SFX and music
- Data persistence (possibility to leave the game without losing progress)
- Different themes

The ASCII arts were found in the [ASCII Art Archive](https://www.asciiart.eu/).
